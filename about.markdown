## About me ##

[Sreejith K](/about/) (aka [semk](http://github.com/semk)/[splusk](http://twitter.com/splusk)) is a [Python](http://python.org) Developer living in Chennai, India. He is a passionate [GNU/Linux](http://linux.org) [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) and a sports lover who skips his sleep to watch all [FCBarcelona](http://fcbarcelona.cat) matches live. When he's not busy, you'd find him mashing buttons on his [PlayStation 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) playing his [favourite games](/games/).

## My setup ##

Recently I switched from a Toshiba Satellite L310 laptop to a [13" Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/in/macbookpro/specs-13inch.html) (MC700, Intel Core i5, 4GB RAM) which I use for all my computing needs. I use [Vim](http://vim.org), [TextMate](http://macromates.com) and [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) for all the coding and editing purposes and prefer iTerm for commandline access. And I coudn't live without my Ubuntu VM's running under [Parallels Desktop 6](www.parallels.com/products/desktop/).
