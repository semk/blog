<p>In my downtime, I like to work on a handful of projects. Most of them are
open-sourced and available on BitBucket or github. If you think any of these
are fun, useful, entertaining, then cool. Feel free to drop me a line with
comments or report any bugs to the appropriate bug-tracker.</p>

<p>I'd had plans to make a small personal blog website for some time, and
after I dumped the experiment I had been working with based on Hyde, I
decided to give <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (the project that
originally inspired Hyde) a try. In addition to being a cozy campfire place
for me to tell my stories, I am using it as a teaching tool for myself to learn
Jekyll, git, and HTML5 and other web technologies.</p>

<p>Started as a day project when I realized it would be handy to have some
dummy content while working on my website. I knew I could just go to 
<a href="http://lipsum.org">lipsum.org</a>, but I thought it would be more fun
to try and create a generator I could train. I still have some plans to expand
it, but I did get it to a complete enough stage where I didn't feel ridiculous
publishing it as a <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/lorem-ipsum">rubygem</a>.</p>

<p>Started when I wanted to begin familiarizing myself with some of the
Mercurial source. Working with the configuration seemed like it would be
something relatively safe and easy to test the waters. I had seen a number of
questions on StackOverflow about why there wasn't a way to programmatically
edit the configuration files &agrave; la git, so I began hacking away on this.
I've since half come around to the reasoning as to why that functionality is
not available, and accordingly the time I've spent on that extension has
slowed accordingly.</p>
