He is a passionate [GNU/Linux](http://linux.org) [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) and a sports lover.

This blog is generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a blog-aware static site generator using [Markdown](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/maruku.html) for writing posts. I use a simple [Rakefile](https://github.com/semk/semk.github.com/blob/master/Rakefile) for rebuilding and deploying this website. After creating new posts, a simple `rake deploy` will update the contents in this site. Entire source code for this website can be found on my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/semk/semk.github.com).
